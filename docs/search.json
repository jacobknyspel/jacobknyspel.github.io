    "text": "1) Multivariate twin model\nOur first step is to run a generic multivariate twin model to estimate genetic and environmental covariance matrices. The umxACEv() function is a good option for this model. For the sake of simplicity, only an AE model is included here. In practice, it is important to compare ACE, AE, CE and E models to arrive at the best fitting one.\n\n# Run ACE model\nACE &lt;- umxACEv(selDVs = selDVs, dzData = dzData1, mzData = mzData1, sep = \"_T\")\n\n# Reduce model to AE model\nAE &lt;- umxModify(lastFit = ACE, update = ACE$top$C$labels, name = \"AE\")\n\nIf the model is producing status codes 5 or 6, it is first worth re-running it with mxTryHard() or using a different optimizer via umx_set_optimizer(). If it is still producing these status codes, we can check if it is locally identified.\n\n# Check if model is locally identified\nmxCheckIdentification(AE)$status\n\nIf the model is not locally identified, it would benefit from being made simpler, perhaps by removing the variables with the smallest twin correlations one at a time. Once we have an acceptable model, we can extract the genetic and non-shared environmental covariance matrices and perform some additional checks to ensure they are suitable for the next step.\n\n# Extract A and E matrices\nA &lt;- AE$top$A$values\nE &lt;- AE$top$E$values\n\n# Check if matrices are symmetric\nisSymmetric(A)\nisSymmetric(E)\n\n# Check if eigenvalues are non-negative\nsum(eigen(A)$values &gt;= 0) &gt; 0\nsum(eigen(E)$values &gt;= 0) &gt; 0\n\nIf a matrix is not symmetric or has any negative eigenvalues, this means it is not positive semi-definite, which will present a problem for network analysis. In this case, it is worth trying umxACE() instead of umxACEv(). This function will ensure that the matrices are positive semi-definite, although it is more easily subject to status codes 5 and 6. If we are happy with the matrices, we can then begin our network analysis."

If this does not work, it is worth proceeding to the next step anyway, which is sparsifying the models.

    "text": "Extra) Comparing steps 2 and 3\nSince we used cross-validation here, it would be useful for us to compare the consistency in results between our initial network analysis (step 2) and subsequent network twin model (step 3). The more consistent the results are across the two halves of the sample, the more confident we can be that our estimated networks are robust. There are many metrics we could use to assess consistency.
