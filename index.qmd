Hi! I'm a PhD student at King's College London, funded by a studentship from the [KCL MRC DTP](https://kcl-mrcdtp.com/). My area of research is the genetics of common mental health conditions. I'm especially interested in improving causal inference and phenotypic specificity in psychiatric genetics research through the implementation of multivariate statistical methods such as graphical modelling and structural equation modelling.
