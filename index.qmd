## Hi!

I'm currently a PhD student in Behavioural Genetics at King's College London, funded by a studentship from the [KCL MRC DTP](https://kcl-mrcdtp.com/). I'm especially interested in improving phenotypic specificity in behavioural genetics research through the implementation of multivariate statistical methods such as network analysis and structural equation modelling.
